# GeoLite2 City

Includes the free [GeoLite2](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/geolite2/) database from MaxMind, for a convenient way of including it in projects without having to embed a big file in your app repo or to keep it outside the repo.

MaxMind updates the database monthly on their site. We make no guarantees about updating this lib regularly, but contributions are welcome – feel free to make a pull request if you'd like us to update this gem and we haven't, or let us know if you would like to be a maintainer.

The version scheme for this gem reflects the date of the embedded MaxMind database, e.g. version `2018.08.07`. We may add another position for any maintenance releases, e.g. `2018.08.07.1`.

Please be aware that this is a relatively large gem due to the embedded database. At the time of writing, it's about 55 MB.


## Usage

`GeoLite2City::DB_PATH` will be the path to the `.mmdb` database.

We've used it with the [MaxMindDB](https://github.com/yhirose/maxminddb) gem. The database can be a bit slow to load (hundreds of ms), so we suggest doing it only once, e.g. in `config/initializers/maxmind_db.rb` in a Rails project:

``` ruby
MAXMIND_DB = MaxMindDB.new(GeoLite2City::DB_PATH)
```

(By putting it in an initializer, it will be present before the app server (such as Unicorn) forks worker processes, meaning it will use as little memory as possible.)

To look up an IP:

``` ruby
MAXMIND_DB.lookup("74.125.225.224")
```

See [the MaxMindDB documentation](https://github.com/yhirose/maxminddb) for more.

There is also an offical [MaxMind DB Reader](https://github.com/maxmind/MaxMind-DB-Reader-ruby) library.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

``` ruby
gem "geolite2_city"
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install geolite2_city


## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

### Updating the DB

* Run `bundle`
* Run `rake db:update` and make a pull request with the result
* Release the gem
* Prosper‽
